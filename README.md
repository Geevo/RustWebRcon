# RustWebRcon
Simple Rust WebRcon library for capturing in-game events

The code was originally ripped out of much bigger project we had that had a website, repo and discord bot.
At the time of developing we couldn't find anything that worked for us.


Inspiration for the parsers comes from SourceRCON:  https://github.com/ScottKaye/CoreRCON

We make use of websocket-sharp: https://github.com/sta/websocket-sharp
